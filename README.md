# Neocraft Archive
Neocraft is a minecraft server that me and a couple friends have, and this repository contains the world downloads for the past seasons of the server. To play on a world, click on a world file and click view raw. This will start the download. After the download is complete, extract the file, and place the resulting folder in your minecraft world saves folder. When you start minecraft next, the world should be in the list!
